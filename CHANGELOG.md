# Changelog for RCCL

Full documentation for RCCL is available at [https://rccl.readthedocs.io](https://rccl.readthedocs.io)

## Unreleased - RCCL 2.24.3 for ROCm 6.5.0

### Resolved issues
* Resolved an issue when using more than 64 channels when multiple collectives are used in the same `ncclGroup()` call.
* Suboptimal algorithmic switching point for AllReduce on MI300x

### Added

* Added new GPU target `gfx950`.
* Added support for `unroll=1` in device-code generation to improve performance
* Added MSCCL support for AllGather single node and multinode (i.e., 8, 16 and 32 GPUs). To enable on multinode, set the
  environment variable `RCCL_MSCCL_FORCE_ENABLE=1`. Max message size for MSCCL AllGather usage is `12292 * sizeof(datatype) * nGPUs`.
* Thread thresholds for LL/LL128 are selected in Tuning Models for the MI300X. This impacts the number of channels used for AG and RS. Channel tuning model is bypassed if `NCCL_THREAD_THRESHOLDS`, `NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS', or 'NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` are set.
* Multi-node tuning for AllGather, AllReduce, and ReduceScatter that leverages LL/LL64/LL128 protocol to use nontemporal vector load/store for tunable message size ranges.
* LL/LL128 usage ranges for AR, AG, and RS are part of the tuning models, which enable architecture-specific tuning in conjunction with the existing Rome Models scheme in RCCL.
* Two new APIs are exposed as part of an initiative to separate RCCL code. These APIs are `rcclGetAlgoInfo` and `rcclFuncMaxSendRecvCount`. However, user-level invocation requires that RCCL be built with `RCCL_EXPOSE_STATIC` enabled.

### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.24.3

## Unreleased - RCCL 2.23.4 for ROCm 6.4.1

### Added

* Added MSCCL support for multinode gfx942/gfx950 (i.e., 16 and 32 GPUs). To enable, set the
  environment variable `RCCL_MSCCL_FORCE_ENABLE=1`. Max message size for MSCCL AllGather usage is `12292 * sizeof(datatype) * nGPUs`.
* Added synchronization before destroying proxy thread to fix a rare hang caused by early termination.

### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.23.4

### Resolved issues

* Fixed the accuracy issue for MSCCLPP `allreduce7` kernel in graph mode.
* Fixed IntraNet performance.

## RCCL 2.22.3 for ROCm 6.4.0

### Added

* `RCCL_SOCKET_REUSEADDR` and `RCCL_SOCKET_LINGER` environment parameters.
* Setting `NCCL_DEBUG=TRACE NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=VERBS` will generate traces for fifo and data `ibv_post_sends`.
* Added `--log-trace` flag to enable traces through the install.sh script (e.g. `./install.sh --log-trace`).

### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.22.3
* Added support for the rail-optimized tree algorithm for the MI300 series. This feature requires the use of all eight GPUs within
  each node. It limits NIC traffic to use only GPUs of the same index across nodes and should not impact performance
  on non-rail-optimized network topologies. The original method of building trees can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable `RCCL_DISABLE_RAIL_TREES=1`.
* Additional debug information about how the trees are built can be logged to the GRAPH logging subsys by setting
  `RCCL_OUTPUT_TREES=1`.
* Added documentation about the NPS4 and CPX partition modes performance benefits on the MI300X.

## RCCL 2.21.5 for ROCm 6.3.1

### Added

### Changed

* Enhanced user documentation

### Resolved issues

### Added

* MSCCL++ integration for AllReduce and AllGather on gfx942
* Performance collection to rccl_replayer
* Tuner Plugin example for MI300
* Tuning table for large number of nodes
* Support for amdclang++
* Allow NIC ID remapping using `NCCL_RINGS_REMAP` environment variable

### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.21.5
* Increased channel count for MI300X multi-node
* Enabled MSCCL for single-process multi-threaded contexts
* Enabled gfx12
* Enabled CPX mode for MI300X
